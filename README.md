# ps4mgr

CLI manager for Phantasy Star IV files. Does not modify ROMs directly, instead edits assembly files from lory90's disassembly.

# Dependencies

NodeJS is the only dependency. Go to https://nodejs.org to install Node if you don't have it already. The ```node``` command must be in your path.

# Usage

```node launcher.js``` to get started. You can also launch scripts individually, e.g. ```node ps4snd.js``` to launch ps4snd.

For individual script help, type "h" at an interactive prompt.
